A NEW HOPE

From the
JOURNAL OF THE WHILLS

by
George Lucas

Revised Fourth Draft
January 15, 1976

LUCASFILM LTD.


LUKE
(over comlink)
Shut down all the garbage mashers on 
the detention level.

THREEPIO
(to Artoo)
No. Shut them all down! Hurry!

Threepio holds his head in agony as he hears the incredible 
screaming and hollering from Luke's comlink.

THREEPIO
Listen to them! They're dying, Artoo! 
Curse my metal body! I wasn't fast 
enough. It's all my fault! My poor 
master!

LUKE
(over comlink)
Threepio, we're all right!

INT. DEATH STAR - GARBAGE ROOM

The screaming and hollering is the sound of joyous relief. 
The walls have stopped moving. Han, Chewie and Leia embrace 
in the background.

LUKE
We're all right. You did great.

Luke moves to the pressure sensitive hatch, looking for a 
number.

LUKE
Hey... hey, open the pressure 
maintenance hatch on unit number... 
where are we?

INT. DEATH STAR - MAIN FORWARD BAY - SERVICE PANEL

HAN
(over comlink)
Three-two-six-eight-two-seven.

INT. DEATH STAR - TRACTOR BEAM - POWER GENERATOR TRENCH

Ben enters a humming service trench that powers the huge 
tractor beam. The trench seems to be a hundred miles deep. 
The clacking sound of huge switching devices can be heard. 
The old Jedi edges his his way along a narrow ledge leading 
to a control panel that connects two large cables. He 
carefully makes several adjustments in the computer terminal, 
and several lights on the board go from red to blue.

INT. DEATH STAR - UNUSED HALLWAY

The group exits the garbage room into a dusty, unused hallway.  
Han and Luke remove the trooper suits and strap on the blaster 
belts.

HAN
If we can just avoid any more female 
advice, we ought to be able to get 
out of here.

Luke smiles and scratches his head as he takes a blaster 
from Solo.

LUKE
Well, let's get moving!

Chewie begins growling and points to the hatch to the garbage 
room, as he runs away and then stops howling.

HAN
(to Chewie)
Where are you going?

The Dia Nogu bangs against the hatch and a long, slimy 
tentacle works its way out of the doorway searching for a 
victim. Han aims his pistol.

LEIA
No, wait. They'll hear!

Han fires at the doorway. The noise of the blast echoes 
relentlessly throughout the empty passageway. Luke simply 
shakes his head in disgust.

HAN
(to Chewie)
Come here, you big coward!

Chewie shakes his head "no."

HAN
Chewie! Come here!

LEIA
Listen. I don't know who you are, or 
where you came from, but from now 
on, you do as I tell you. Okay?

Han is stunned at the command of the petite young girl.

HAN
Look, Your Worshipfulness, let's get 
one thing straight! I take orders 
from one person! Me!

LEIA
It's a wonder you're still alive.
(looking at Chewie)
Will somebody get this big walking 
carpet out of my way?

Han watches her start away. He looks at Luke.

HAN
No reward is worth this.

They follow her, moving swiftly down the deserted corridor.

INT. DEATH STAR - POWER TRENCH

Suddenly a door behind Ben slides open and a detachment of 
stormtroopers marches to the power trench. Ben instantly 
slips into the shadows as an Officer moves to within a few 
feet of him.

OFFICER
Secure this area until the alert is 
canceled.

FIRST TROOPER
Give me regular reports.

All but two of the stormtroopers leave.

FIRST TROOPER
Do you know what's going on?

SECOND TROOPER
Maybe it's another drill.

Ben moves around the tractor beam, watching the stormtroopers 
as they turn their backs to him. Ben gestures with his hand 
toward them, as the troops think they hear something in the 
other hallway. With the help of the Force, Ben deftly slips 
past the troopers and into the main hallway.

SECOND TROOPER
What was that?

FIRST TROOPER
Oh, it's nothing. Don't worry about 
it.

INT. DEATH STAR - HALLWAY

Luke, Han, Chewbacca, and Leia run down an empty hallway and 
stop before a bay window overlooking the pirateship. Troopers 
are milling about the ship. Luke takes out his pocket comlink.

HAN
(looking at his ship)
There she is.

LUKE
See-Threepio, do you copy?

THREEPIO
(voice)
For the moment. Uh, we're in the 
main hangar across from the ship.

LUKE
We're right above you. Stand by.

Han is watching the dozen or so troops moving in and out of 
the pirateship. Leia moves towards Han, touches his arm and 
points out the window to the ship.

LEIA
You came in that thing? You're braver 
that I thought.

HAN
Nice! Come on!

Han gives her a dirty look, and they start off down the 
hallway. They round a corner and run right into twenty 
Imperial stormtroopers heading toward them. Both groups are 
taken by surprise and stop in their tracks.

FIRST TROOPER
It's them! Blast them!

Before even thinking, Han draws his laser pistol and charges 
the troops, firing. His blaster knocks one of the 
stormtroopers into the air. Chewie follows his captain down 
the corridor, stepping over the fallen trooper on the floor.

HAN
(to Luke and Leia)
Get back to the ship!

LUKE
Where are you going? Come back!

Han has already rounded a corner and does not hear.

LEIA
He certainly has courage.

LUKE
What good will it do us if he gets 
himself killed? Come on!

Luke is furious but doesn't have time to think about it for 
muted alarms begin to go off down on the hangar deck. Luke 
and Leia start off toward the starship hangar.

INT. DEATH STAR - SUBHALLWAY

Han chases the stormtroopers down a long subhallway. He is 
yelling and brandishing his laser pistol. The troops reach a 
dead end and are forced to turn and fight. Han stops a few 
feet from them and assumes a defensive position. The troops 
begin to raise their laser guns. Soon all ten troopers are 
moving into an attack position in front of the lone 
starpirate. Han's determined look begins to fade as the troops 
begin to advance. Solo jumps backward as they fire at him.

INT. DEATH STAR - SUBHALLWAY

Chewbacca runs down the subhallway in a last-ditch attempt 
to save his bold captain. Suddenly he hears the firing of 
laser guns and yelling. Around the corner shoots Han, pirate 
extraordinaire, running for his life, followed by a host of 
furious stormtroopers. Chewbacca turns and starts running 
the other way also.

INT. DEATH STAR - SUBHALLWAY

Luke fires his laser pistol wildly as he and Leia rush down 
a narrow subhallway, chased by several stormtroopers. They 
quickly reach the end of the subhallway and race through an 
open hatchway.

INT. DEATH STAR - CENTRAL CORE SHAFT

Luke and Leia race through the hatch onto a narrow bridge 
that spans a huge, deep shaft that seems to go into infinity. 
The bridge has been retracted into the wall of the shaft, 
and Luke almost rushes into the abyss. He loses his balance 
off the end of the bridge as Leia, behind him, takes hold of 
his arm and pulls him back.

LUKE
(gasping)
I think we took a wrong turn.

Blasts from the stormtroopers' laser guns explode nearby 
reminding them of the oncoming danger. Luke fires back at 
the advancing troops. Leia reaches over and hits a switch 
that pops the hatch door shut with a resounding boom, leaving 
them precariously perched on a short piece of bridge overhang.  
Laserfire from the troopers continues to hit the steel door.

LEIA
There's no lock!

Luke blasts the controls with his laser pistol.

LUKE
That oughta hold it for a while.

LEIA
Quick, we've got to get across. Find 
the control that extends the bridge.

LUKE
Oh, I think I just blasted it.

Luke looks at the blasted bridge control while the 
stormtroopers on the opposite side of the door begin making 
ominous drilling and pounding sounds.

LEIA
They're coming through!

Luke notices something on his stormtrooper belt, when 
laserfire hits the wall behind him. Luke aims his laser pistol 
at a stormtrooper perched on a higher bridge overhang across 
the abyss from them. They exchange fire. Two more troops 
appear on another overhang, also firing. A trooper is hit, 
and grabs at his chest.

Another trooper standing on the bridge overhang is hit by 
Luke's laserfire, and plummets down the shaft. Troopers move 
back off the bridge; Luke hands the gun to Leia.

LUKE
Here, hold this.

Luke pulls a thin nylon cable from his trooper utility belt. 
It has a grappler hook on it. A trooper appears on a bridge 
overhang and fires at Luke and Leia. As Luke works with the 
rope, Leia returns the laser volley. Another trooper appears 
and fires at them, as Leia returns his fire as well.  
Suddenly, the hatch door begins to open, revealing the feet 
of more troops.

LEIA
Here they come!

Leia hits one of the stormtroopers on the bridge above, and 
he falls into the abyss. Luke tosses the rope across the 
gorge and it wraps itself around an outcropping of pipes. He 
tugs on the rope to make sure it is secure, then grabs the 
princess in his arms. Leia looks at Luke, then kisses him 
quickly on the lips. Luke is very surprised.

LEIA
For luck!

Luke pushes off and they swing across the treacherous abyss 
to the corresponding hatchway on the opposite side. Just as 
Luke and Leia reach the far side of the canyon, the 
stormtroopers break through the hatch and begin to fire at 
the escaping duo. Luke returns the fire before ducking into 
the tiny subhallway.

INT. DEATH STAR - NARROW PASSAGEWAY

Ben hides in the shadows of the narrow passageway as several 
stormtroopers rush past him in the main hallway. He checks 
to make sure they're gone, then runs down the hallway in the 
opposite direction. Darth Vader appears at the far end of 
the hallway and starts after the old Jedi.

INT. DEATH STAR - MAIN FORWARD BAY

Threepio looks around at the troops milling about the 
pirateship entry ramp.

THREEPIO
Where could they be?

Artoo, plugged into the computer socket, turns his dome left 
and right, beeping a response.

INT. DEATH STAR - CORRIDOR - BLAST SHIELDS DOOR

Han and Chewbacca run down a long corridor with several 
troopers hot on their trail.

TROOPER
Close the blast doors!

At the end of the hallway, blast doors begin to close in 
front of them. The young starpilot and his furry companion 
race past the huge doors just as they are closing, and manage 
to get off a couple off laserblasts at the pursuing troops 
before the doors slam shut.

TROOPER
Open the blast doors! Open the blast 
doors!

INT. DEATH STAR - HALLWAY LEADING TO MAIN FORWARD BAY

Ben hurries along one of the tunnels leading to the hangar 
where the pirateship waits. Just before he reaches the hangar, 
Darth Vader steps into view at the end of the tunnel, not 
ten feet away. Vader lights his saber. Ben also ignites his 
and steps slowly forward.

VADER
I've been waiting for you, Obi-Wan. 
We meet again, at last. The circle 
is now complete.

Ben Kenobi moves with elegant ease into a classical offensive 
position. The fearsome Dark Knight takes a defensive stance.

VADER
When I left you, I was but the 
learner; now I am the master.

BEN
Only a master of evil, Darth.

The two Galactic warriors stand perfectly still for a few 
moments, sizing each other up and waiting for the right 
moment. Ben seems to be under increasing pressure and strain, 
as if an invisible weight were being placed upon him. He 
shakes his head and, blinking, tries to clear his eyes.

Ben makes a sudden lunge at the huge warrior but is checked 
by a lightning movement of The Sith. A masterful slash stroke 
by Vader is blocked by the old Jedi. Another of the Jedi's 
blows is blocked, then countered. Ben moves around the Dark 
Lord and starts backing into the massive starship hangar. 
The two powerful warriors stand motionless for a few moments 
with laser swords locked in mid-air, creating a low buzzing 
sound.

VADER
Your powers are weak, old man.

BEN
You can't win, Darth. If you strike 
me down, I shall become more powerful 
than you can possibly imagine.

Their lightsabers continue to meet in combat.

INT. DEATH STAR - MAIN FORWARD BAY

Han Solo and Chewbacca, their weapons in hand, lean back 
against the wall surveying the forward bay, watching the 
Imperial stormtroopers make their rounds of the hangar.

HAN
Didn't we just leave this party?

Chewbacca growls a reply, as Luke and the princess join them.

HAN
What kept you?

LEIA
We ran into some old friends.

LUKE
Is the ship all right?

HAN
Seems okay, if we can get to it. 
Just hope the old man got the tractor 
beam out of commission.

INT. DEATH STAR - HALLWAY

Vader and Ben Kenobi continue their powerful duel. As they 
hit their lightsabers together, lightning flashes on impact. 
Troopers look on in interest as the old Jedi and Dark Lord 
of The Sith fight. Suddenly Luke spots the battle from his 
group's vantage point.

LUKE
Look!

Luke, Leia, Han, and Chewie look up and see Ben and Vader 
emerging from the hallways on the far side of the docking 
bay.

INT. DEATH STAR - DOCKING BAY

Threepio and Artoo-Detoo are in the center of the Death Star's 
Imperial docking bay.

THREEPIO
Come on, Artoo, we're going!

Threepio ducks out of sight as the seven stormtroopers who 
were guarding the starship rush past them heading towards 
Ben and The Sith Knight. He pulls on Artoo.

INT. DEATH STAR - HALLWAY

Solo, Chewie, Luke, and Leia tensely watch the duel. The 
troops rush toward the battling knights.

HAN
Now's our chance! Go!

They start for the Millennium Falcon. Ben sees the troops 
charging toward him and realizes that he is trapped. Vader 
takes advantage of Ben's momentary distraction and brings 
his mighty lightsaber down on the old man. Ben manages to 
deflect the blow and swiftly turns around.

The old Jedi Knight looks over his shoulder at Luke, lifts 
his sword from Vader's then watches his opponent with a serene 
look on his face.

Vader brings his sword down, cutting old Ben in half. Ben's 
cloak falls to the floor in two parts, but Ben is not in it.  
Vader is puzzled at Ben's disappearance and pokes at the 
empty cloak. As the guards are distracted, the adventurers 
and the robots reach the starship. Luke sees Ben cut in two 
and starts for him. Aghast, he yells out.

LUKE
No!

The stormtroopers turn toward Luke and begin firing at him.  
The robots are already moving up the ramp into the Millennium 
Falcon, while Luke, transfixed by anger and awe, returns 
their fire. Solo joins in the laserfire. Vader looks up and 
advances toward them, as one of his troopers is struck down.

HAN
(to Luke)
Come on!

LEIA
Come on! Luke, its too late!

HAN
Blast the door! Kid!

Luke fires his pistol at the door control panel, and it 
explodes. The door begins to slide shut. Three troopers charge 
forward firing laser bolts, as the door slides to a close 
behind them, shutting Vader and the other troops out of the 
docking bay. A stormtrooper lies dead at the feet of his 
onrushing compatriots. Luke starts for the advancing troops, 
as Solo and Leia move up the ramp into the pirateship. He 
fires, hitting a stormtrooper, who crumbles to the floor.

BEN'S VOICE
Run, Luke! Run!

Luke looks around to see where the voice came from. He turns 
toward the pirateship, ducking Imperial gunfire from the 
troopers and races into the ship.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

Han pulls back on the controls and the ship begins to move. 
The dull thud of laser bolts bouncing off the outside of the 
ship as Chewie adjusts his controls.

HAN
I hope the old man got that tractor 
beam out if commission, or this is 
going to be a real short trip. Okay, 
hit it!

Chewbacca growls in agreement.

EXT. MILLENNIUM FALCON

The Millennium Falcon powers away from the Death Star docking 
bay, makes a spectacular turn and disappears into the vastness 
of space.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - CENTRAL HOLD AREA

Luke, saddened by the loss of Obi-Wan Kenobi, stares off 
blankly as the robots look on. Leia puts a blanket around 
him protectively, and Luke turns and looks up at her. She 
sits down beside him.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

Solo spots approaching enemy ships.

HAN
(to Chewie)
We're coming up on the sentry ships. 
Hold 'em off! Angle the deflector 
shields while I charge up the main 
guns!

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - CENTRAL HOLD AREA

Luke looks downward sadly, shaking his head back and forth, 
as the princess smiles comfortingly at him.

LUKE
I can't believe he's gone.

Artoo-Detoo beeps a reply.

LEIA
There wasn't anything you could have 
done.

Han rushes into the hold area where Luke is sitting with the 
princess.

HAN
(to Luke)
Come on, buddy, we're not out of 
this yet!

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - GUNPORTS - COCKPIT

Solo climbs into his attack position in the topside gunport.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - HOLD AREA

Luke gets up and moves out toward the gunports as Leia heads 
for the cockpit.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - GUNPORTS - COCKPIT

Luke climbs down the ladder into the gunport cockpit, settling 
into one of the two main laser cannons mounted in large 
rotating turrets on either side of the ship.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - SOLO'S GUNPORT

Han adjusts his headset as he sits before the controls of 
his laser cannon, then speaks into the attached microphone.

HAN
(to Luke)
You in, kid? Okay, stay sharp!

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - GUNPORTS - COCKPIT

Chewbacca and Princess Leia search the heavens for attacking 
TIE fighters. The Wookiee pulls back on the speed controls 
as the ship bounces slightly.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - SOLO'S GUNPORT - COCKPIT

Computer graphic readouts form on Solo's target screen, as 
Han reaches for controls.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - GUNPORT - COCKPIT

Luke sits in readiness for the attack, his hand on the laser 
cannon's control button.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT.

Chewbacca spots the enemy ships and barks.

LEIA
(into intercom)
Here they come!

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT - POV (POINT OF VIEW) - 
SPACE

The Imperial TIE fighters move towards the Millennium Falcon, 
one each veering off to the left and right of the pirateship.

INT. TIE FIGHTER - COCKPIT

The stars whip past behind the Imperial pilot as he adjusts 
his maneuvering joy stick.

EXT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - IN SPACE

The TIE fighter races past the Falcon, firing laser beams as 
it passes.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - HOLD AREA

Threepio is seated in the hold area, next to Artoo-Detoo. 
The pirateship bounces and vibrates as the power goes out in 
the room and then comes back on.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT - GUNPORTS

A TIE fighter maneuvers in front of Han, who follows it and 
fires at it with the laser cannon. Luke does likewise, as 
the fighter streaks into view. The ship has suffered a minor 
hit, and bounces slightly.

EXT. SPACE

Two TIE fighters dive down toward the pirateship.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - GUNPORTS

Luke fires at an unseen fighter.

LUKE
They're coming in too fast!

EXT. SPACE - MILLENNIUM FALCON/TIE FIGHTERS

Pan with pirateship as two TIE fighters charge through the 
background. Laserbolts streak from all the craft.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - CHEWBACCA

The ship shudders as a laserbolt hits very close to the 
cockpit. The Wookiee chatters something to Leia.

EXT. TIE FIGHTER - SPACE

Full shot of a TIE fighter as it moves fast through the frame, 
firing on the pirate starship.

EXT. SPACE - TIE FIGHTERS

The two TIE fighters fire a barrage of laserbeams at the 
pirateship.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - MAIN PASSAGEWAY

A laserbolt streaks into the side of the pirateship. The 
ship lurches violently, throwing poor Threepio into a cabinet 
fill of small computer chips.

THREEPIO
Oooh!

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT - GUNPORTS

Leia watches the computer readout as Chewbacca manipulates 
the ship's controls.

LEIA
We've lost lateral controls.

HAN
Don't worry, she'll hold together.

An enemy laserbolt hits the pirateship's control panel, 
causing it to blow out in a shower of sparks.

HAN
(to ship)
You hear me, baby? Hold together!

Artoo-Detoo advances toward the smoking sparking control 
panel, dousing the inferno by spraying it with fire retardant 
beeping all the while.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - GUNPORT

Luke swivels in his gun mount, following the TIE fighter 
with his laser cannon.

fighter in his sights, releasing a blast of laserfire. He 
connects, and the fighter explodes into fiery dust. Han laughs 
victoriously.

EXT. SPACE

Two TIE fighters move toward and over the Millennium Falcon, 
unleashing a barrage of laserbolts at the ship.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - GUNPORTS

Another TIE fighter moves in on the pirateship and Luke, 
smiling, fires the laser cannon at it, scoring a spectacular 
direct hit.

LUKE
Got him! I got him!

Han turns and gives Luke a victory wave which Luke gleefully 
returns.

HAN
Great kid! Don't get cocky.

Han turns back to his laser cannon.

EXT. SPACE

Two more TIE fighters cross in front of the pirateship.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

While Chewbacca manipulates the controls, Leia turns, looking 
over her shoulder out the ports.

LEIA
There are still two more of them out 
there!

EXT. SPACE

A TIE fighter moves up over the pirateship, firing laserblasts 
at it.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - GUNPORTS

Luke and Han look into their respective projected target 
screens. An Imperial fighter crosses Solo's port, and Han 
swivels in his chair, following it with blasts from his laser 
cannon. Another fighter crosses Luke's port, and he reacts 
in a like manner, the glow of his target screen lighting his 
face.

EXT. SPACE

The TIE fighter zooms toward the pirateship, firing 
destructive blasts at it.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - GUNPORTS

Luke fires a laserblast at the approaching enemy fighter, 
and it bursts into a spectacular explosion. Luke's projected 
screen gives a readout of the hit. The pirateship bounces 
slightly as it is struck by the enemy fire.

EXT. SPACE - TIE FIGHTER

The last of the attacking Imperial TIE fighters looms in, 
firing upon the Falcon.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - GUNPORT

Solo swivels behind his cannon, his aim describing the arc 
of the TIE fighter. The fighter comes closer, firing at the 
pirateship, but a well-aimed blast from Solo's laser cannon 
hits the attacker, which blows up in a small atomic shower 
of burning fragments.

LUKE
(laughing)
That's it! We did it!

The princess jumps up and gives Chewie a congratulatory hug.

LEIA
We did it!

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - PASSAGEWAY

Threepio lies on the floor of the ship, completely tangled 
in the smoking, sparking wires.

THREEPIO
Help! I think I'm melting!
(to Artoo)
This is all your fault.

Artoo turns his dome from side to side, beeping in response.

EXT. SPACE - MILLENNIUM FALCON

The victorious Millennium Falcon moves off majestically 
through space.

INT. DEATH STAR - CONTROL ROOM

Darth Vader strides into the control room, where Tarkin is 
watching the huge view screen. A sea of stars is before him.

TARKIN
Are they away?

VADER
They have just made the jump into 
hyperspace.

TARKIN
You're sure the homing beacon is 
secure aboard their ship? I'm taking 
an awful risk, Vader. This had better 
work.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

Han, removes his gloves and smiling, is at the controls of 
the ship. Chewie moves into the aft section to check the 
damage. Leia is seated near Han.

HAN
Not a bad bit of rescuing, huh? You 
know, sometimes I even amaze myself.

LEIA
That doesn't sound too hard. Besides, 
they let us go. It's the only 
explanation for the ease of our 
escape.

HAN
Easy... you call that easy?

LEIA
Their tracking us!

HAN
Not this ship, sister.

Frustrated, Leia shakes her head.

LEIA
At least the information in Artoo is 
still intact.

HAN
What's so important? What's he 
carrying?

LEIA
The technical readouts of that battle 
station. I only hope that when the 
data is analyzed, a weakness can be 
found. It's not over yet!

HAN
It is for me, sister! Look, I ain't 
in this for your revolution, and I'm 
not in it for you, Princess. I expect 
to be well paid. I'm in it for the 
money!

LEIA
You needn't worry about your reward. 
If money is all that you love, then 
that's what you'll receive!

She angrily turns, and as she starts out of the cockpit, 
passes Luke coming in.

LEIA
Your friend is quite a mercenary. I 
wonder if he really cares about 
anything... or anyone.

LUKE
I care!

Luke, shaking his head, sits in the copilot seat. He and Han 
stare out at the vast blackness of space.

LUKE
So... what do you think of her, Han?

HAN
I'm trying not to, kid!

LUKE
(under his breath)
Good...

HAN
Still, she's got a lot of spirit. I 
don't know, what do you think? Do 
you think a princess and a guy like 
me...

LUKE
No!

Luke says it with finality and looks away. Han smiles at 
young Luke's jealousy.

EXT. SPACE AROUND FOURTH MOON OF YAVIN

The battered pirateship drifts into orbit around the planet 
Yavin and proceeds to one of its tiny green moons.

EXT. FOURTH MOON OF YAVIN

The pirateship soars over the dense jungle.

EXT. MASSASSI OUTPOST

An alert guard, his laser gun in hand, scans the countryside.  
He sets the gun down and looks toward the temple, barely 
visible in the foliage.

EXT. MASSASSI OUTPOST - JUNGLE TEMPLE

Rotting in a forest of gargantuan trees, an ancient temple 
lies shrouded in an eerie mist. The air is heavy with the 
fantastic cries of unimaginable creatures. Han, Luke and the 
others are greeted by the Rebel troops.

Luke and the group ride into the massive temple on an armored 
military speeder.

INT. MASSASSI - MAIN HANGAR DECK

The military speeder stops in a huge spaceship hangar, set 
up in the interior of the crumbling temple. Willard, the 
commander of the Rebel forces, rushes up to the group and 
gives Leia a big hug. Every one is pleased to see her.

WILLARD
(holding Leia)
You're safe! We had feared the worst.

Willard composes himself, steps back and bows formally.

WILLARD
When we heard about Alderaan, we 
were afraid that you were... lost 
along with your father.

LEIA
We don't have time for our sorrows, 
Commander. The battle station has 
surely tracked us here.
(looking pointedly to 
Han)
It's the only explanation for the 
ease of our escape. You must use the 
information in this R2 unit to plan 
the attack. It is our only hope.

EXT. SPACE

The surface of the Death Star ominously approaches the red 
planet Yavin.

INT. DEATH STAR - CONTROL ROOM

Grand Moff Tarkin and Lord Vader are interrupted in their 
discussion by the buzz of the comlink. Tarkin moves to answer 
the call.

TARKIN
Yes.

DEATH STAR INTERCOM VOICE

We are approaching the planet Yavin. The Rebel base is on a 
moon on the far side. We are preparing to orbit the planet.

EXT. YAVIN - JUNGLE

A lone guard stands in a tower high above the Yavin landscape, 
surveying the countryside. A mist hangs over the jungle of 
twisted green.

INT. MASSASSI - WAR ROOM BRIEFING AREA

Dodonna stands before a large electronic wall display. Leia 
and several other senators are to one side of the giant 
readout. The low-ceilinged room is filled with starpilots, 
navigators, and a sprinkling of R2-type robots. Everyone is 
listening intently to what Dodonna is saying. Han and 
Chewbacca are standing near the back.

DODONNA
The battle station is heavily shielded 
and carries a firepower greater than 
half the star fleet. It's defenses 
are designed around a direct large-
scale assault. A small one-man fighter 
should be able to penetrate the outer 
defense.

Gold Leader, a rough looking man in his early thirties, stands 
and addresses Dodonna.

GOLD LEADER
Pardon me for asking, sir, but what 
good are snub fighters going to be 
against that?

DODONNA
Well, the Empire doesn't consider a 
small one-man fighter to be any 
threat, or they'd have a tighter 
defense. An analysis of the plans 
provided by Princess Leia has 
demonstrated a weakness in the battle 
station.

Artoo-Detoo stands next to a similar robot, makes beeping 
sounds, and turns his head from right to left.

DODONNA
The approach will not be easy. You 
are required to maneuver straight 
down this trench and skim the surface 
to this point. The target area is 
only two meters wide. It's a small 
thermal exhaust port, right below 
the main port. The shaft leads 
directly to the reactor system. A 
precise hit will start a chain 
reaction which should destroy the 
station.

A murmer of disbelief runs through the room.

DODONNA
Only a precise hit will set up a 
chain reaction. The shaft is ray-
shielded, so you'll have to use proton 
torpedoes.

Luke is sitting next to Wedge Antilles, a hotshot pilot about 
sixteen years old.

WEDGE
That's impossible, even for a 
computer.

LUKE
It's not impossible. I used to bull's-
eye womp rats in my T-sixteen back 
home. They're not much bigger than 
two meters.

DODONNA
Man your ships! And may the Force be 
with you!

The group rises and begins to leave.

EXT. SPACE

The Death Star begins to move around the planet toward the 
tiny green moon.

INT. DEATH STAR

Tarkin and Vader watch the computer projected screen with 
interest, as a circle of lights intertwines around one another 
on the screen showing it's position in relation to Yavin and 
the forth moon.

DEATH STAR INTERCOM VOICE

Orbiting the planet at maximum velocity. The moon with the 
Rebel base will be in range in thirty minutes.

VADER
This will be a day long remembered. 
It has seen the end of Kenobi and it 
will soon see the end of the 
Rebellion.

INT. MASSASSI OUTPOST - MAIN HANGAR DECK

Luke, Threepio and little Artoo enter the huge spaceship 
hangar and hurry along a long line of gleaming spacefighters.  
Flight crews rush around loading last-minute armaments and 
unlocking power couplings. In an area isolated from this 
activity Luke finds Han and Chewbacca loading small boxes 
onto an armored speeder.

MAN'S VOICE
(over loudspeaker)
All flight trooper, man your stations. 
All flight troops, man your stations.

Han is deliberately ignoring the activity of the fighter 
pilots' preparation. Luke is quite saddened at the sight of 
his friend's departure.

LUKE
So... you got your reward and you're 
just leaving then?

HAN
That's right, yeah! I got some old 
debts I've got to pay off with this 
stuff. Even if I didn't, you don't 
think I'd be fool enough to stick 
around here, do you? Why don't you 
come with us? You're pretty good in 
a fight. I could use you.

LUKE
(getting angry)
Come on! Why don't you take a look 
around? You know what's about to 
happen, what they're up against. 
They could use a good pilot like 
you. You're turning your back on 
them.

HAN
What good's a reward if you ain't 
around to use it? Besides, attacking 
that battle station ain't my idea of 
courage. It's more like suicide.

LUKE
All right. Well, take care of 
yourself, Han. I guess that's what 
you're best at, isn't it?

Luke goes off and Han hesitates, then calls to him.

HAN
Hey, Luke... may the Force be with 
you!

Luke turns and sees Han wink at him. Luke lifts his hand in 
a small wave and then goes off.

Han turns to Chewie who growls at his captain,

HAN
What're you lookin' at? I know what 
I'm doing.

INT. MAIN HANGAR DECK - LUKE'S SHIP

Luke, Leia, and Dodonna meet under a huge space fighter.

LEIA
What's wrong?

LUKE
Oh, it's Han! I don't know, I really 
thought he'd change his mind.

LEIA
He's got to follow his own path. No 
one can choose it for him.

LUKE
I only wish Ben were here.

Leia gives Luke a little kiss, turns, and goes off. As Luke 
heads for his ship, another pilot rushes up to him and grabs 
his arm.

BIGGS
Luke! I don't believe it! How'd you 
get here... are you going out with 
us?!

LUKE
Biggs! Of course, I'll be up there 
with you! Listen, have I got some 
stories to tell...

Red Leader, a rugged handsome man in his forties, comes up 
behind Luke and Biggs. He has the confident smile of a born 
leader.

RED LEADER
Are you... Luke Skywalker? Have you 
been checked out on the Incom T-sixty-
five?

BIGGS
Sir, Luke is the best bushpilot in 
the outer rim territories.

Red Leader pats Luke on the back as they stop in front of 
his fighter.

RED LEADER
I met your father once when I was 
just a boy, he was a great pilot. 
You'll do all right. If you've got 
half of your father's skill, you'll 
do better than all right.

LUKE
Thank you, sir. I'll try.

Red Leader hurries to his own ship.

BIGGS
I've got to get aboard. Listen, you'll 
tell me your stories when we come 
back. All right?

LUKE
I told you I'd make it someday, Biggs.

BIGGS
(going off)
You did, all right. It's going to be 
like old times, Luke. We're a couple 
of shooting stars that'll never be 
stopped!

Luke laughs and shakes his head in agreement. He heads for 
his ship.

As Luke begins to climb up the ladder into his sleek, deadly 
spaceship, the crew chief, who is working on the craft, points 
to little Artoo, who is being hoisted into a socket on the 
back of the fighter.

CHIEF
This R2 unit of your seems a bit 
beat up. Do you want a new one?

LUKE
Not on your life! That little droid 
and I have been through a lot 
together.
(to Artoo)
You okay, Artoo?

The crewmen lower Artoo-Detoo into the craft. Now a part of 
the exterior shell of the starship, the little droid beeps 
that he is fine.

Luke climbs up into the cockpit of his fighter and puts an 
his helmet. Threepio looks on from the floor of the massive 
hangar as the crewmen secure his little electronic partner 
into Luke's X-wing. It's an emotional-filled moment as Artoo 
beeps good-bye.

CHIEF
Okay, easy she goes!

THREEPIO
Hang on tight,Artoo, you've got to 
come back.

Artoo beeps in agreement.

THREEPIO
You wouldn't want my life to get 
boring, would you?

Artoo whistles his reply.

All final preparations are made for the approaching battle.  
The hangar is buzzing with the last minute activity as the 
pilots and crewmen alike make their final adjustments. The 
hum of activity is occasionally trespassed by the distorted 
voice of the loudspeaker issuing commands. Coupling hoses 
are disconnected from the ships as they are fueled. Cockpit 
shields roll smoothly into place over each pilot. A signalman, 
holding red guiding lights, directs the ships. Luke, a trace 
of a smile gracing his lips, peers about through his goggles.

BEN'S VOICE
Luke, the Force will be with you.

Luke is confused at the voice and taps his headphones.

EXT. MASSASSI OUTPOST - JUNGLE

All that can be seen of the fortress is a lone guard standing 
on a small pedestal jutting out above the dense jungle. The 
muted gruesome crying sounds that naturally permeate this 
eerie purgatory are overwhelmed by the thundering din of ion 
rockets as four silver starships catapult from the foliage 
in a tight formation and disappears into the morning cloud 
cover.

INT. MASSASSI OUTPOST - WAR ROOM

The princess, Threepio, and a field commander sit quietly 
before the giant display showing the planet Yavin and its 
four moons. The red dot that represents the Death Star moves 
ever closer to the system. A series of green dots appear 
around the fourth moon. A din of indistinct chatter fills 
the war room.

MASSASSI INTERCOM VOICE
Stand-by alert. Death Star 
approaching. Estimated time to firing 
range, fifteen minutes.

EXT. SPACE

The Death Star slowly moves behind the massive yellow surface 
of Yavin in the foreground, as many X-wing fighters flying 
in formation zoom toward us and out of the frame.

EXT. SPACE - ANOTHER ANGLE

Light from a distant sun creates an eerie atmospheric glow 
around a huge planet, Yavin. Rebel fighters flying in 
formation settle ominously in the foreground and very slowly 
pull away.

INT. RED LEADER STARSHIP - COCKPIT

Red Leader lowers his visor and adjusts his gun sights, 
looking to each side at his wing men.

RED LEADER

field.

INT. RED LEADER'S COCKPIT

RED LEADER
Hold tight!

INT. LUKE'S X-WING FIGHTER - COCKPIT

Luke adjusts his controls as he concentrates on the 
approaching Death Star. The ship begins to be buffeted 
slightly.

RED LEADER
(over headset)
Switch your deflectors on.

INT. ANOTHER COCKPIT

RED LEADER
(over headset)
Double front!

EXT. SPACE

The fighters, now X-shaped darts, move in formation. The 
Death Star now appears to be a small moon growing rapidly in 
size as the Rebel fighters approach. Complex patterns on the 
metallic surface begin to become visible. A large dish antenna 
is built into the surface on one side.

INT. WEDGE'S COCKPIT

Wedge is amazed and slightly frightened at the awesome 
spectacle.

WEDGE
Look at the size of that thing!

RED LEADER
(over headset)
Cut the chatter, Red Two.

INT. RED LEADER'S COCKPIT

RED LEADER
Accelerate to attack speed. This is 
it, boys!

EXT. SPACE

As the fighters move closer to the Death Star, the awesome 
size of the gargantuan Imperial fortress is revealed. Half 
of the deadly space station is in shadow and this area 
sparkles with thousands of small lights running in thin lines 
and occasionally grouped in large clusters; somewhat like a 
city at night as seen from a weather satellite.

INT. GOLD LEADER'S COCKPIT

GOLD LEADER
Red Leader, this is Gold Leader.

RED LEADER
(over headset)
I copy, Gold Leader.

GOLD LEADER
We're starting for the target shaft 
now.

INT. RED LEADER'S COCKPIT

Red Leader looks around at his wingmen; the Death Star looming 
in from behind. Two Y-wing fighters bob back and forth in 
the background. He moves his computer targeting device into 
position.

RED LEADER
We're in position. I'm going to cut 
across the axis and try and draw 
their fire.

EXT. SPACE

Two squads of Rebel fighters peel off. The X-wings dive 
towards the Death Star surface. A thousand lights glow across 
the dark grey expanse of the huge station.

INT. DEATH STAR

Alarm sirens scream as soldiers scramble to large turbo- 
powered laser gun emplacements. Electronic drivers rotate 
the huge guns into position as crew adjust their targeting 
devices.

EXT. SPACE AROUND THE DEATH STAR

Laserbolts streak through the star-filled night. The Rebel X-
wing fighters move in toward the Imperial base, as the Death 
Star aims its massive laser guns at the Rebel forces and 
fires.

INT. MASSASSI OUTPOST - WAR ROOM

Princess Leia listens to the battle over the intercom.  
Threepio is at her side.

WEDGE
(over war room speaker 
system)
Heavy fire, boss! Twenty-degrees.

RED LEADER
(over speaker)
I see it. Stay low.

EXT. SPACE

An X-wing zooms across the surface of the Death Star.

INT. DEATH STAR

Technical crews scurry here and there loading last-minute 
armaments and unlocking power cables.

INT. WEDGE'S COCKPIT

Wedge maneuvers his fighter toward the menacing Death Star.

EXT. SPACE

X-wings continue in their attack course on the Death Star.

INT. LUKE'S X-WING FIGHTER - COCKPIT

Luke nosedives radically, starting his attack on the monstrous 
fortress. The Death Star surface streaks past the cockpit 
window.

LUKE
This is Red Five; I'm going in!

EXT. SPACE

Luke's X-wing races toward the Death Star. Laserbolts streak 
from Luke's weapons, creating a huge fireball explosion on 
the dim surface.

INT. LUKE'S X-WING FIGHTER - COCKPIT

Terror crosses Luke's face as he realizes he won't be able 
to pull out in time to avoid the fireball.

BIGGS
(over headset)
Luke, pull up!

EXT. SURFACE OF DEATH STAR

Luke's ship emerges from the fireball, with the leading edges 
of his wings slightly scorched.

INT. BIGGS' COCKPIT

BIGGS
Are you all right?

INT. LUKE'S X-WING FIGHTER - COCKPIT

Luke adjusts his controls and breathes a sigh of relief. 
Flak bursts outside the cockpit window.

LUKE
I got a little cooked, but I'm okay.

EXT. SURFACE OF THE DEATH STAR

Rebel fighters continue to strafe the Death Star's surface 
with laserbolts.

INT. DEATH STAR

Walls buckle and cave in. Troops and equipment are blown in 
all directions. Stormtroopers stagger out of the rubble.  
Standing in the middle of the chaos, a vision of calm and 
foreboding, is Darth Vader. One of his Astro-Officers rushes 
up to him.

ASTRO-OFFICER
We count thirty Rebel ships, Lord 
Vader. But they're so small they're 
evading our turbo-lasers!

VADER
We'll have to destroy them ship to 
ship. Get the crews to their fighters.

INT. DEATH STAR

Smoke belches from the giant laser guns as they wind up their 
turbine generators to create sufficient power. The crew rushes 
about preparing for another blast. Even the troopers head 
gear is not adequate to protect them from the overwhelming 
noise of the monstrous weapon. One troopers bangs his helmet 
with his hand in an attempt to stop the ringing.

INT. READ LEADER'S X-WING FIGHTER - COCKPIT - TRAVELING

Red Leader flies through a heavy hail of flak.

RED LEADER
Luke, let me know when you're going 
in.

INT. LUKE'S X-WING - COCKPIT - TRAVELING

The Red Leader's X-wing flies past Luke as he puts his nose 
down and starts his attack dive.

LUKE
I'm on my way in now...

RED LEADER
Watch yourself! There's a lot of 
fire coming from the right side of 
that deflection tower.

LUKE
I'm on it.

EXT. SURFACE OF THE DEATH STAR

Luke flings his X-wing into a twisting dive across the horizon 
and down onto the dim grey surface.

EXT. LUKE'S X-WING TRAVELING

A shot hurls from Luke's guns. Laserbolts streak toward the 
onrushing Death Star surface. Several small radar emplacements 
erupt in flame. Laserfire erupts from a protruding tower on 
the surface.

INT. LUKE'S X-WING - COCKPIT - TRAVELING

The blurry Death Star surface races past the cockpit window 
as a big smile sweeps across Luke's face at the success of 
his run. Flak thunders on all sides of him.

EXT. SURFACE OF THE DEATH STAR

The Death Star superstructure races past Luke as he maneuvers 
his craft through a wall of laserfire and peels away from 
the surface towards the heavens.

INT. DEATH STAR

The thunder and smoke of the big guns reverberate throughout 
the massive structure. Many soldiers rush about in the smoke 
and chaos, silhouetted by the almost continual flash of 
explosions.

INT. BIGGS' COCKPIT - TRAVELING

Biggs dives through a forest of radar domes, antennae, and 
gun towers as he shoots low across the Death Star surface. A 
dense barrage of laserfire streaks by on all sides.

INT. DEATH STAR

Imperial star pilots dash in unison to a line of small 
auxiliary hatches that lead to Imperial TIE fighters.

INT. MASSASSI OUTPOST - WAR ROOM

Princess Leia, surrounded by her generals and aides, paces 
nervously before a lighted computer table. On all sides 
technicians work in front of many lighted glass walls. Dodonna 
watches quietly from one corner. One of the officers working 
over a screen speaks into his headset.

CONTROL OFFICER
Squad leaders, we've picked up a new 
group of signals. Enemy fighters 
coming your way.

INT. LUKE'S X-WING - COCKPIT - TRAVELING

Luke looks around to see if he can spot the approaching 
Imperial fighters.

LUKE
My scope's negative. I don't see 
anything.

INT. RED LEADER'S X-WING - COCKPIT - TRAVELING

The Death Star's surface sweeps past as Red Leader searches 
the sky for the Imperial fighters. Flak pounds at his ship.

RED LEADER
Keep up your visual scanning. With 
all this jamming, they'll be on top 
of you before your scope can pick 
them up.

EXT. SURFACE OF THE DEATH STAR

Silhouetted against the rim lights of the Death Star horizon, 
four ferocious Imperial TIE ships dive on the Rebel fighters.  
Two of the TIE fighters peel off and drop out of frame. Pan 
with the remaining two TIE ships.

INT. BIGGS' COCKPIT - TRAVELING

Biggs panics when he discovers a TIE ship on his tail. The 
horizon in the background twists around as he peels off, 
hoping to lose the Imperial fighter.

INT. RED LEADER'S COCKPIT

RED LEADER
Biggs! You've picked one up... watch 
it!

BIGGS
I can't see it! Where is he?!

EXT. SPACE AROUND THE DEATH STAR

Biggs zooms off the surface and into space, closely followed 
by an Imperial TIE fighter. The TIE ship fires several 
laserbolts at Biggs, but misses.

INT. BIGGS' COCKPIT - TRAVELING

Biggs see the TIE ship behind him and swings around, trying 
to avoid him.

BIGGS
He's on me tight, I can't shake him... 
I can't shake him.

EXT. SPACE AROUND THE DEATH STAR

Biggs, flying at high altitude, peels off and dives toward 
the Death Star surface, but he is unable to lose the TIE 
fighter, who sticks close to his tail.

INT. X-WING FIGHTER - COCKPIT - TRAVELING

Luke is flying upside down. He rotates his ship around to 
normal attitude as he comes out of his dive.

LUKE
Hang on, Biggs, I'm coming in.

EXT. SPACE AROUND THE DEATH STAR

Biggs and the tailing TIE ship dive for the surface, now 
followed by a fast-gaining Luke. After Biggs dives out of 
sight, Luke chases the Imperial fighter.

EXT. SURFACE AROUND THE DEATH STAR

In the foreground, the Imperial fighter races across the 
Death Star's surface, closely followed by Luke in the 
background.

INT. LUKE'S X-WING FIGHTER - COCKPIT - TRAVELING

There is a shot from Luke's X-wing of the TIE ship exploding 
in a mass of flames.

LUKE
Got him!

INT. DEATH STAR

Darth Vader strides purposefully down a Death Star corridor, 
flanked by Imperial stormtroopers.

VADER
Several fighters have broken off 
from the main group. Come with me!

INT. MASSASSI OUTPOST - WAR ROOM

LUKE
I'm hit, but not bad.

EXT. LUKE'S X-WING FIGHTER

Smoke pours out from behind Artoo-Detoo.

LUKE'S VOICE
Artoo, see what you can do with it. 
Hang on back there.

Green laserfire moves past the beeping little robot as his 
head turns.

INT. LUKE'S X-WING - COCKPIT

Luke nervously works his controls.

RED LEADER

surface of the huge station. The ship moves into a deep 
trench, firing laserbolts. The surface streaks past as 
laserfire is returned by the Death Star.

INT. GOLD FIVE'S Y-WING - COCKPIT - TRAVELING

Gold Five is a pilot in his early fifties with a very battered 
helmet that looks like it's been through many battles. He 
looks around to see if enemy ships are near. His fighter is 
buffeted by Imperial flak.

INT. GOLD LEADER'S Y-WING - COCKPIT

Gold Leader races down the enormous trench that leads to the 
exhaust port. Laserbolts blast toward him in increasing 
numbers, occasionally exploding near the ship causing it to 
bounce about.

targeting eye viewer and adjusts it. His ship shudders under 
intense laser barrage.

GOLD TWO
Computer's locked. Getting a signal.

As the fighters begin to approach the target area, suddenly 
all the laserfire stops. An eerie clam clings over the trench 
as the surface whips past in a blur.

GOLD TWO
The guns... they've stopped!

EXT. GOLD FIVE'S COCKPIT

Gold Five looks behind him.

GOLD FIVE
Stabilize your read deflectors. Watch

Well, I wasn't gonna let you get all 
the credit and take all the reward.

at Luke's face. Leia moves in between them.

(laughing)
Hey, I knew there was more to you 
than money.

Luke looks toward the ship.

Oh, no!

The fried little Artoo-Detoo is lifted off the back of the 
fighter and carried off under the worried eyes of Threepio.

Oh, my! Artoo! Can you hear me? Say 
something!
(to mechanic)
You can repair him, can't you?

TECHNICIAN

gladly donate them.

He'll be all right.

INT. MASSASSI OUTPOST - MAIN THRONE ROOM

Luke, Han, and Chewbacca enter the huge ruins of the main 
temple. Hundreds of troops are lined up in neat rows. Banners 
are flying and at the far end stands a vision in white, the 
beautiful young Senator Leia. Luke and the others solemnly 
march up the long aisle and kneel before Senator Leia. From 
one side of the temple marches a shined-up and fully repaired 
Artoo-Detoo. He waddles up to the group and stands next to 
an equally pristine Threepio, who is rather awestruck by the 
whole event. Chewbacca is confused. Dodonna and several other 
dignitaries sit on the left of the Princess Leia. Leia is 
dressed in a long white dress and is staggeringly beautiful.  
She rises and places a gold medallion around Han's neck. He 
winks at her. She then repeats the ceremony with Luke, who 
is moved by the event. They turn and face the assembled 
troops, who all bow before them. Chewbacca growls and Artoo 
beeps with happiness.
